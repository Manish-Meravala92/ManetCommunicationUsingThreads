# ManetCommunicationUsingThreads
- We have considered a standard network topology of a MANET.

- In this network, the task for Source Node is to route a path to Destination Node for exchange of message.

- But there can be multiple paths available through which Source Node can send message to Destination Node.

- However, we must select a path which is optimal and to deduce that path we need to use a protocol known as Shortest path algorithm.

- Using the specified algorithm, we must calculate the distance or cost of each path and select the path which is the shortest.

- The calculation of distances for multiple paths can be done sequentially or with the use of multiple threads
